# HybridModel (HM)

**Version 1.0**

The *HybridModel* tool is designed to calculate the seismic parameters of fault-type and zone-type sources in a region, based on the earthquakes recorded in the seismic catalog. The program is structured to find all possible combinations of:

- **β-value for fault-type sources (btf)**
- **β-value for zone-type sources (btz)**
- **Maximum magnitude for the zone-type source (MmaxZone)**

These combinations maintain the seismic system in balance.

All results generated by the program are mathematically valid. However, it is up to the user to select those combinations that best reflect the tectonic context of the region and the completeness of the seismic catalog, using the maximum completeness magnitude (**MmaxC**) as a reference.

Users may also integrate selected combinations into a logic tree for final seismic hazard calculations, if desired.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The energy distribution is always based on the same seismic catalog and the same fault geometry information. Therefore, the final seismic hazard results from any of the combinations should not significantly differ in terms of the calculated ground acceleration.
